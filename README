HPL-NVIDIA 24.03.0  -- NVIDIA accelerated HPL benchmark -- NVIDIA
===============================================================================
High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark (HPL)
HPL - 2.1 - October 26, 2012
===============================================================================

HPL-NVIDIA is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear system in
double precision (64-bit) arithmetic on distributed-memory computers equipped
with NVIDIA GPUs, based on the netlib HPL benchmark.

The HPL-NVIDIA software package is provided in a self-contained NVIDIA 
HPL-Benchmarks NGC container collection with all dependencies included.

Running:
  See the file RUNNING in this directory.

Tuning:
  See the file TUNING in this directory.

Additional Script for Benchmark Logging
===============================================================================

This repository includes a custom Bash script (`plot.sh`) that enhances the 
benchmarking process by:

1. **Setting the problem size (N)** for the HPL benchmark dynamically.
2. **Logging power and UPS metrics** from a connected UPS system before, 
   during, and after the benchmark.
3. **Storing results** in a CSV file for later analysis.

### Usage
```bash
./plot.sh <Problem_Size>
